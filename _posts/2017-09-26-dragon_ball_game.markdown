## Summary
---
When I first started programming, I went on a game project to familiarize myself with Javascript.

I thought there would be a problem with the image license. If there's a problem, please comment below.
But, I decided to release this code on Github and hope to be helpful for juniors.

Please enjoy this game. Thanks.
